This program calculates the exact odds of Battles in the revised edition of
Axis and Allies. It currently does not take the first strike ability of
submarines in to account. You may also get some weird results if you have
illegal battles (like infantry vs. aircraft carriers). Since this program is
calculates the odds exactly — it does not simulate them — it is very slow for
large battles. I may add simulation capability later to speed this up.

Controls:

Technology and unit selection is self explanatory.

Caclulate: finds the odds for the battle.

Reset: clears all technology and unit selections.

Attacker wins: probability of attacker winning.

Defender wins: probability of defender winning.

Mutual annihilation: probability of no units surviving the battle.

Sum: The sum of the previous three probabilities. This is shown as a debugging
feature — it should always be "1.0". If it is not, feel free to contact the
author with details about the battle.

Battles: The program calculates battle odds by breaking a large battle in to
smaller battles which are easier to calculate. The results of these
intermediate battles are stored in memory to speed up computation (because the
results of the same mini battle are often required multiple times to find the
results of the overall battle). Storing these battles can speed up
calculations of other battles, however if the number of stored battles gets two
long, it could slow down calculations because the program frequently has to
search through all of them.

Reset Battles: Clears the memory of stored battles to solve the slowdown
problem.
