This program calculates the exact odds of Battles in the revised edition of
Axis and Allies. It currently does not take the first strike ability of
submarines in to account, but all other rules are implemented. Since this program
calculates the odds explicitly — it does not simulate them — it can be slow for
large battles. Although it is not required, having the Ruby/GSL package
installed will speed up calculations.

Controls:

Technology and AA guns: click the appropriate check boxes.

Adding units: either use the up and down arrows, or enter the text directly in
to the boxes.

Sorting units: this is the order the units will be lost in. The first unit to
be lost is at the top. Clicking "value" or "power" will sort the units by that
criteria. You can also put them in a custom order using the up and down
buttons. They will move whatever units is currently selected in the list. After
hitting 'Calculate', numbers will appear next to the units. See the next item
for an explanation.

Calculate: finds the odds for the battle. This will add numbers next to the
units in the lists. The number is the probability that the unit (and all units
lost after it) will survive the battle.

Clear: clears the units for the associated side.

Attacker wins: probability of attacker winning.

Defender wins: probability of defender winning.

Mutual annihilation: probability of no units surviving the battle.

Sum: The sum of the previous three probabilities. This is shown as a debugging
feature — it should always be very close to "1.0". If it is not, feel free to
contact the author with details about the battle.

Save Last Battle: saves the details of the calculated battle in a text file for
future reference.
