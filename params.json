  "body": "# aaodds: An odds calculator for Axis and Allies\r\n\r\nThis program calculates the exact odds for battles in the revised edition of the Axis and Allies board game; it does not estimate the results using randomness. There are two versions of the program: an offline program with a graphical user interface made with Tk, and an online version that is used through a web browser. All rules except special submarine rules (first strike, cannot attack aircraft) are implemented. I have a plan for how to implement sub rules -- I'll get around to it when I have time and if there's demand. The current version is quite speedy if Ruby/GSL is installed (otherwise, it's somewhat slower).\r\n\r\n======\r\n## TK interface\r\n\r\n![The TK version.](http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~lmaurer/code/aacalc/aacalc_screen_shot.png)\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\nTechnology and AA guns: click the appropriate check boxes.\r\n\r\nAdding units: either use the up and down arrows, or enter the text directly in to the boxes.\r\n\r\nSorting units: this is the order the units will be lost in. The first unit to be lost is at the top. Clicking \"value\" or \"power\" will sort the units by that criteria. You can also put them in a custom order using the up and down buttons. They will move whatever units is currently selected in the list. After hitting 'Calculate', numbers will appear next to the units. See the next item for an explanation.\r\n\r\nCalculate: finds the odds for the battle. This will add numbers next to the units in the lists. The number is the probability that the unit (and all units lost after it) will survive the battle.\r\n\r\nClear: clears the units for the associated side.\r\n\r\nAttacker wins: probability of attacker winning.\r\n\r\nDefender wins: probability of defender winning.\r\n\r\nMutual annihilation: probability of no units surviving the battle.\r\n\r\nSum: The sum of the previous three probabilities. This is shown as a debugging feature â€” it should always be very close to \"1.0\". If it is not, feel free to contact the author with details about the battle.\r\n\r\nSave Last Battle: saves the details of the calculated battle in a text file for future reference.",
